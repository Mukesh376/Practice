The conversion to void* when using the %p format specifier in printf is necessary to ensure that the pointer is printed correctly. The %p specifier expects a void* pointer, and casting to void* ensures that the pointer is interpreted correctly by the printf function.

Explanation
Format Specifier %p:

The %p format specifier is used to print pointer addresses.
It expects an argument of type void*.
Pointer Type Compatibility:

Different pointer types (e.g., int*, char*, etc.) may have different representations.
Casting to void* standardizes the representation, ensuring that printf handles the pointer correctly.
Avoiding Warnings or Errors:

Without casting to void*, some compilers may issue warnings or errors because the type expected by %p does not match the type of the provided pointer.



uname -m

The uname -m command is used to display the machine hardware name. It provides information about the machine architecture, such as x86_64, i686, armv7l, etc.
